I am a M.S. student in Economics at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. My research interests lie at the intersection of **agricultural economics, environmental economics, and resource management**, with a particular focus on how agricultural production decisions interact with environmental externalities and policy incentives.

I am especially interested in understanding how farm-level management choices (such as fertilizer application and livestock operations) contribute to water quality impacts, and how policy interventions can improve both environmental outcomes and farm economic sustainability. My current work applies **panel data econometrics and causal inference methods** (including instrumental variables and Difference-in-Differences frameworks) to study how climate variability and farmers’ adaptive behavior affect agricultural productivity in the U.S. Corn Belt.

In future work, I aim to examine the environmental impacts of livestock production systems, particularly nutrient runoff and its downstream ecological consequences. I am also interested in integrating **remote-sensing, hydrological, and agricultural datasets** to better quantify environmental damages and evaluate the effectiveness of related regulatory frameworks.

I plan to pursue a Ph.D. in Agricultural and Resource Economics, where I hope to continue developing empirical strategies to inform the design of more efficient and environmentally sustainable agricultural policies.
